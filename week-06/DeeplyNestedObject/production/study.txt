Grace Park - A Long Distance Relationship

Introduction
Romantic relationships are the way that two people connect with eachother emotionally, 
characterized by mutual feelings of wanting to be with eachother.
In a relationship, you experience a lot of small details about eachother, 
like the details of one's body or the way someone smells.

In a long distance relationship many of these small details are lost, and cannot be sensed through our devices. 
What does it mean to be truly known by someone? What is lost in a long distance relationship? 

What is lost?

1. Physically
The quality of phone cameras cannot capture what could be seen in person. 
- The gentle curl of your pretty eyelashes
- The location of all your moles
- The texture of your hair after a shower

2. Emotionally
I sense your presence, but it's a ghost of the real you
- We cannot directly look into eachother's eyes anymore
- We can't grip our hands when we see someone we dislike
- We accidentally talk over eachother at times

3. Memories
As more time passes, details of memories may fade away. 
- How did we greet one another when we see eachother? 
- What were you wearing when we went on that date?
- Why didn't we take more photos with eachother?


What is still there?

1. Physically
I'm glad that I can still see you.
- You show me where you sleep now, and details of a room I will never see
- I know where you're going, because you show me photos of your new experiences
- I still see your smile

2. Emotionally
We try our best to be with one another.
- I still hear about what you've done today, and what you will do tomorrow
- You listen to my problems and I give you advice on yours
- We send gifts with mementos of our past, and think about our future

3. Memories
It's not the same, but we still feel happy. 
- Our video calls and all the new experiences that come are memorable
- We start a lot of our conversations with "remember when" and end with "I want to do that again with you"
- We plan out what we'll do when we see eachother again, promising eachother flowers
